    <h2 class="hero-title">Touring Guide</h2>

    <p class="hero-sub">
      This map-linked ski touring guide brings together GPX tracks, photos, and practical notes in one place.
      I created it after finding it surprisingly difficult to locate concise, route-specific GPX information without endlessly scrolling through scattered trip reports.
      The guide is a curated collection of some of my own ski touring tracks, complemented by images and brief observations from the field.
      These routes reflect personal experiences and are not guaranteed to represent the best or safest approach under all conditions.
      <b>Always assess current local conditions and consult the avalanche forecast before heading out.</b>
